# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Ovierview
The objective in this project was to take the amazon product reviews and analyze the data. To show proficiency in Big Data, Spark, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, SQL, and Google Colab. At the end of all of our research, I will determine whether or not there is any bias for the reviews in the Vine Program.

## Summary
Unpaid reviews cam out at 54% while paid reviews came out at 38%. The paid reviews are a little more harsh of the scores while the unpaid reviews are a little more lenient. That would be a negative bias towards the Vine reviewers.
